@Jermaine:when i was doing construction people kept joking about how inadequate a helmet is at protecting u from anything serious
@Wingman‏:Buddy's brother who claims safety policies in construction are "liberal bureaucracy" wasn't wearing his helmet & took something to the head
@Lord_Sugar:Thats the norm nowadays. U wear a helmet to ride your bike so why not in a building construction site ? Its all common sense.
@OliverHuebler:If you work on a construction site, you’re required to wear a helmet." #bettersafethansorry #safetyatwork http://nyti.ms/2dbNF7u
@Jess:People think I'm trying to be part of the Village People but this is just part of my job. Classy work attire w/ construction vest & helmet.
@Jim_ogan:My cathedral construction safety helmet. I should have thought of this sooner.
